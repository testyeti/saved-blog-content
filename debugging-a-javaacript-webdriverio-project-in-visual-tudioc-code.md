# Debugging a JavaScript WebdriverIO project in Visual Studio Code

Have you also tried WebdriverIO (the popular library for developing Selenium WebDriver test scenarios using Node.JS), but not yet come across a way to enjoy that type of debugging experience?

Visual Studio Code is a useful, lightweight, open-source IDE with support for debugging Node.JS apps.

And it allows you to interactively debug WebdriverIO code. So, in this post I'll document how to configure VS Code as your one-stop-shop for interactive WebdriverIO debugging!

We'll start from the beginning, installing each piece of software you need - and once that's complete, we'll build and debug a WebdriverIO test in the VS Code IDE.

Let's begin!

# Installing Java

Things will go more smoothly later if you first ensure you have java in your shell's PATH. WebdriverIO will expect it to be present so it can launch the Selenium standalone server (which is a Java app) for you.

So, install a JRE for your platform before going further (if you don't already have one).

#I nstalling Node.JS

Both WebdriverIO and VS Code will expect you to provide your own installation of Node.JS. For that, you have a few choices:

You can visit https://nodejs.org/ and download an installer.

Or, nvm works great as well (it allows you to install multiple node versions).

Or, Mac folks can use Homebrew or MacPorts - I used MacPorts to install nodejs6 and npm4 as shown here:

    sudo port install nodejs6 npm4

As of this writing, the versions MacPorts installs are as follows:

    $ node -v && npm -v
    v6.9.1
    4.0.2

Those versions will be what I use for the rest of this tutorial.

# Creating a WebdriverIO Project

These steps are based on the developer guide at http://webdriver.io/guide.html, with a few small changes.

I'll keep this brief and to the point, so we can quickly get to the VS Code specifics - see the dev guide link above if you need more details on a particular step.

    # Create a new dir for your project
    mkdir webdriverio-test && cd webdriverio-test

    # Create a boilerplate package.json
    npm init -y

    # Install WebdriverIO, and tell npm to add it as a dependency in package.json

    npm install webdriverio --save-dev

Now, run the WebdriverIO config helper:

    ./node_modules/.bin/wdio config

 It'll prompt you for a series of questions - I accepted the defaults for each, EXCEPT the `Do you want to add a service to your test setup?` question.

For that one, select `selenium-standalone`

Here's what my final settings resembled:

    ? Where do you want to execute your tests? On my local machine
    ? Which framework do you want to use? mocha
    ? Shall I install the framework adapter for you? Yes
    ? Where are your test specs located? ./test/specs/**/*.js
    ? Which reporter do you want to use?
    ? Do you want to add a service to your test setup?  selenium-standalone - https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-selenium-standalone-service
    ? Level of logging verbosity silent
    ? In which directory should screenshots gets saved if a command fails? ./errorShots/
    ? What is the base url? http://localhost

That will create wdio.conf.js in your current dir.

Creating a test spec file

Now create the spec dir that the config utility asked about:

    mkdir -p test/specs

Then create the file `test/specs/foo.spec.js` with these contents:

    var assert = require('assert');
    describe('webdriver.io page', function() {
        it('should have the right title - the fancy generator way', function () {
            // Tell mocha this test is allowed to run for 10 minutes, so we have
            // sufficient time for debugging.
            //
            // Note you can also set this globally in mochaOpts in wdio.conf.js:
            this.timeout(10 * 60 * 1000);

            browser.url('http://webdriver.io');
            var title = browser.getTitle();
            assert.equal(title, 'WebdriverIO - Selenium 2.0 javascript bindings for nodejs');
        });
    });

To see if all is well, run the `./node_modules/.bin/wdio` command to launch your test - you should see a browser launch, and eventually a passing result will be printed:

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/wdio
    
    â€¤

    1 passing (10.00s)

# Debugging with VS Code

If you haven't installed VS Code yet, please do so now :)

Once that's done, use the `File > Open` menu in VS Code to open the `webdriverio-test` folder you created earlier.

# launch.json configuration

Now, let's create a launch.json file and add a configuration for debugging your test spec.

To do that, click `View > Debug` or the debugging icon in the left of the IDE:

vscode-debug-button

Then click the small gear in the debug menu to open launch.json:

vscode-config-gear

Click Node.js in the menu that appears to generate a boilerplate launch.json.

Now, paste the config shown below above the other two premade launch.json configs:

        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 5859,
            "name": "WebdriverIO",
            "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/wdio",
            "windows": {
                "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/wdio.cmd"
            },
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            // This args config runs only the file that's open and displayed
            // (e.g., a file in test/spec/):
            "args":[
                "--spec", "${relativeFile}"
                // To run a specific file, you can also do:
                //"--spec", "test/specs/foo.spec.js"
            ]
        }
Now, delete the two premade configurations in the launch.json list (Launch Program and Attach to Process). We won't be using them.

On my machine the final launch.json resembles:

vscode-launch-json

# Enable debugging in wdio.conf.js

Open `wdio.conf.js` in the editor, and just under the `exports.config = {` line, set the `debug: true` option:

    exports.config = {
        debug: true,

This allows VS Code to connect to the wdio runner for debugging.

If you forget this step, the first time you try to debug the IDE will likely show you the error message `Cannot connect to runtime process (timeout after 10000 ms)`.

# First run

Now it's time for action! Open the `foo.spec.js` file in the IDE, making sure it's the active tab in the editor (so that the file name is plugged into the `${relativeFile}` in your debug config in `launch.json`).

Now click the green play button next to DEBUG in the IDE. You should see your test run to completion, since no breakpoints are set.

vscode-debug-play-button

# Setting a breakpoint

Now place a breakpoint in foo.spec.js, at line 11, by clicking the gutter to the left of the line number (you'll see a red dot appear).

Then press the debug button again and watch the IDE stop execution at line 11, as shown here:

vscode-breakpoint-hit

Click the `DEBUG CONSOLE` menu, click the small prompt box at its bottom, and experiment with adding JS statements - for example:

    browser.getTitle()

That should print the browser window's title as shown here:

vscode-debug-console

Now try inspecting elements interactively with the $ and $$ WebdriverIO helpers - for example:

    $$("div").length

    $$("div")[3].getText()
Note that code completion works here! It comes in handy when guessing at the first few characters of functions you suspect might exist:

vscode-debug-console-code-completion

That's all for now!
